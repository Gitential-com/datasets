This is bad for sdist which uses the relative path of a file to determine which directory it goes into in the source distribution.  To solve the problem, I have sdist search all absolute file paths for the ""greatest common directory"" among them.  This directory is removed from them to determine where the file will go in the distribution directories.  Files without absolute paths are always put in the top directory of the distribution.

This procedure usually ends up with a setup.py module in the top directory of the source distribution and then a number of sub-directories that hold the actual package source code files.

misc_util sprouted another function or two to help with the process of adding package paths to the PYTHONPATH.  There are some assumptions made about where distutils should look for these packages (first in the current directory then in the parent) that may not be generally true, but should work well for scipy.  It also results in setup.py files that work fine from with in scipy or for building stand along packages that may depend on other scipy packages.

I made changes needed to get things rolling for scipy on win32 again.  I've included an email exchange discussing changes below:

I changes are checked into CVS.

1. is_available()
In is_available(), I'm not sure whether any compilers will return an empty version.  I don't think any of them do right now -- but I'm not sure about Sun.  For now, lets use your implementation and deal with it later if it turns out to be a problem.

2. sun compile switches
class sun_fortran_compiler(fortran_compiler_base):

    vendor = 'Sun'
    ver_match =  r'f77: (?P<version>[^\s*,]*)'

    def __init__(self, fc = None, f90c = None):
        ...
        self.f90_switches = ' -fixed ' # ??? why fixed?


I think the fixed is left over from some compiler specific flags I needed in a project at Duke where all of our code was in fixed format.  It probably shouldn't be here.  However, if it isn't, we need a way of specifying the compiler options.  In distutils.extension, there is a

    self.extra_compile_args = extra_compile_args or []

argument.  We need an extra_fcompile_args or something like that.  I think distutils just appends the extra arguments to the end of the compile command.  This is unlikely to work with some Fortran compilers though.  I know the Absoft compiler isn't very sophisticated about handling command line arguments, and any extra args probably need to be placed before the source file in the command.

3. cpu_info.py
Something very similar to this already exists in scipy -- its called proc.py.  I'll look through it and see how to merge the stuff you added into the module.  This stuff is very OS specific and only works on Linux (and maybe BSD).  I wish proc worked on more machine types.

*Well, for now I'm gonna keep the two separate modules.  We'll merge this stuff into proc in the future.

4. optimization flags
I've moved this to a get_opt() function.

Also, we should have a flag to turn *on* machine specific optimization instead of making it the
default.  If people build a binary distibution, it'll only work on specific architectures which can lead to trouble.  This shouldn't be the default behavior.

For now, get_opt() still calls the arch dependent settings by default for the gnu and intel compilers.

5. get_linker_so()
This won't work on windows with mingw32.  The linker is a very strange thing there, and the -shared flag doesn't work.  I've had to add a little code back into the gnu_fortran class and
do a test for win32.  I don't think seeting the libraries and library_dir hurts on linux.  Does it?

6. is_available -> get_version
This is just a better name for it.  is_available is still available... :)  It just calls get_version now.

7. ***  Some vendors provide different compilers for F77 and F90
        compilations. Currently, checking the availability of these
        compilers is based on only checking the availability of the
        corresponding F77 compiler. If it exists, then F90 is assumed
        to exist also.

This is a problem.  Worse than having different ones, gnu fortran doesn't even support f90.  We may want to split this stuff into separate classes.  I'd like to get more feedback from users running into problems on this one.

see ya,
eric

If we move it up in the list, the default behavior will grab the ""better"" (or at least the commercial) compiler installed on the platform.  I think this is more desirable.  People can still specifiy the gnu compiler with a flag if they want to.  If they have many compilers installed, the flag is the only way to do it that I see.

Doing 2 is fine with me -- and you've already done it I see. :)
