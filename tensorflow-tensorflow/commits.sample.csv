Change:
	Clean up documentation for ReverseSequence
Change:
	Updated several tensorflow operations to use 32bit indices on GPU.
Change:
	Add attribute batch_dim to ReverseSequenceOp.
Change:
	Fix error in convert_to_records.py.  As reported in
	https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/370
	by AlexUnderMicrocontRoll.
Change:
	Update TensorBoard README.
Change:
	Fixes to boolean flags reported in
	https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/379.  Supports:

	--bool_flag=True  --> True
	--bool_flag=False  --> False
	--bool_flag=gibberish  --> False
	--bool_flag --> True
	--nobool_flag --> False

	Fixes #379
Change:
	Update generated Op docs.
Change:
	Enable local development of TensorBoard using gulp
	Also make tf-tensorboard a regular component rather than special case

	This is mostly effected by creating tfserve.js, which is a small server
	with clever routing to load from bower_components/ and components/ using
	the paths that work within google3.

	Workflow: `gulp serve`
Change:
	Add a full working code example to the tensorboard and summaries tutorial
Change:
	Fix seq2seq_test when running on GPU.

	The ""proj_w"" and ""proj_b"" variables were being created before the
	`test_session()`'s device function took effect, which pushed the
	placement algorithm into making an incorrect decision.
Change:
	Add a sentence in TensorBoard README on how to serialize summary data to logs and provide link to the how-to tutorial on the TensorFlow website.
Change:
	Add error-catching code if string_input_producer is supplied a null input.
	Before this change, it would die with an opaque shape error from inside
	the queue.  This change catches (most) python null lists being
	passed directly in, and at runtime detects null tensors.

	Adds two tests for this to input_test.py
Change:
	Speed up for models that use the same variable multiple times in the case
	where variables must be copied across devices:
	- Have Variables wrap the Variable op in an Identity op when converted to Tensor.
	  This avoids multiple copies across devices if a variable is used multiple time
	  in a computation.
	- Add Variable.mutable() to return the non-wrapped Variable op for used when
	  assigning new values.
	- Add an as_ref parameter to convert_to_tensor() to allow code to specify
	  if they plan to assign a new value to the result of the conversion.  Make Variable
	  return the result of Variable.mutable() when as_ref is True.
	- Make all ops that assign values to variables pass as_ref=True when converting
	  their arguments.
Change:
	Change to reduce critical section times in gpu_event_mgr.h:
	(1) Call stream->ThenRecordEvent outside the EventMgr critical section
	(2) Do memory deallocation outside the critical section

	Speeds up one configuration of ptb_word_lm from 2924 words per
	second (wps) to 3278 wps on my desktop machine with a Titan X.
Change:
	Remove some colons that break the open source build

	::tensorflow::StringPiece breaks for @raingo, see
	https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/358.
	tensorflow::StringPiece (without the leading colons)
	seems to fix the problem.
Change:
	Added check that inputs to Operation is a list and make a defensive copy of the input. This is for cases where the input list is changed such as in _add_input.
Change:
	Use standard names for TensorFlow dtypes in the tutorial.
Change:
	Add tests for tensor inputs.
Change:
	Fix build after declaring more types for ops
Change:
	Switch to 32 bit indexing to speedup convolutions and concatenations.
Change:
	Add convert_image op to convert between types for images (similar to OpenCV's cvtScale).
Change:
	Make cast work between numeric types (bool, uint8, int16, int32, int64, float, double).
Change:

	Padding input data for odd number of paddings, so we can use cudnn anyway.
	+ Fix total padding computation when padding==VALID.
	+ This CL makes the Googlenet benchmark run 5x faster.

Change:
	Support IndexedSlices in ConcatGrad
Change:
	* sampled softmax op uses one embedding lookup for positive and negative samples
	* float64 support for sampled softmax
Change:
	Move RNN code out of models.rnn (without breaking existing code).  The API may still undergo minor changes, until full documentation as added.
Change:
	Changed to use per-step stacks for the accumulators used in while-loop gradient computation. This addresses the problem caused by using concat without sufficient static shape information. It should also improve performance as we avoided those expensive concats.
Change:
	Update generated Op docs.
Change:
	Improve error messages when the optimizer finds no variables to minimize or
	when none of the variables has gradients.
Change:
	Say that -1 isn't just for flattening in reshape docs

	Also add scalar reshape (reshape(t, [])) as an example.

	This fixes https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/281.
Change:
	This is a test.

	    Undeclared headers are not mounted in the sandbox which make several cc_* rules

	We would like to be able to deprecate behavior in newly generated graphs
	without invalidating tensorflow's ability to read and evaluate old graphs.
	For this purpose, GraphDef now has a version field which can be checked inside
	op kernels to determine how backwards compatible to be.  version.h defines
	TF_GRAPHDEF_VERSION_MIN and TF_GRAPHDEF_VERSION_MAX specifying the range of
	supported GraphDef versions in the current version of tensorflow.

	Also expose tf.__version__ and tf.__graph_def_version{,_min,_max}__ for Python
	interrogation purposes.

	Whenever we want to deprecate or change some GraphDef semantics, we will
	proceed as follows:

	1. Bump TF_GRAPHDEF_VERSION_MAX, leaving TF_GRAPHDEF_VERSION_MIN unchanged.
	   Describe the change in graph.proto, include the date introduced.

	2. In each relevant kernel, implement the new behavior if the GraphDef version
	   is new, but preserve the old behavior for previous GraphDef versions.

	3. Wait six months or so (we need to formalize this somewhere).

	4. Bump TF_GRAPHDEF_VERSION_MIN and remove the backwards compatibility.

	The GraphDef version is distinct from the open source version, but at least
	(4) and possibly (1) correspond to major version number bumps.

	The first GraphDef version bump is the upcoming scalar strictness change,
	which affects Google users only since open source is already scalar strict.

	This commit does not yet plumb the version number into OpKernelConstruction
	so that ops can access it.  That will follow.

	Made TensorShapeProto implicitly convertible to TensorShape.

Change 109418220
	Update WORKSPACE to use gmock.BUILD from google/protobuf instead of a duplicate.
	Update google/protobuf's commit hash to include damieng@'s commit.
Change 109417314
	TensorFlow: add .gitignore to ignore some in-tree modified files.
Change 109400051
	Optionally build full TensorFlow for Android.
	1. --define ANDROID_TYPES=__ANDROID_TYPES_FULL__ to register ops
	   for all types, not just float. Today this increases codesize
	   by ~700K when compiled for ARM, though only for clients who
	   request full type support.
	2. Add more ops to android_extended_ops, sufficient to train on
	   the linear regression baseball codelab.
Change 109388118
	Fix the option changed in templatize. Oops.
Change 109382553
	Allows setting a function name in an op's attr in the py frontend.
Change 109380896
	Remove assert_same_graph in favor of op_scope. Change the latter to handle tensor-like objects such as SparseTensor, IndexedSlices, and Variable.
